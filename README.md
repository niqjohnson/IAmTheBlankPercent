# I Am the Blank Percent

[I Am the Blank Percent](http://iamtheblankpercent.com) is a single-serving site that calculates where your income puts you in the spectrum of American earners.

When I was looking for a new job in 2011, I was curious where my potential income would put me in the "I am the 99 Percent!" scheme of things that was all the rage then. There were a couple of calulators already out there (like ones from the [Wall Street Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/10/19/what-percent-are-you/) and [Political Calculations](http://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2011/09/distribution-of-income-for-2010.html)), but I wanted a "single serving site" that only told me "I am the blank percent." So I made one.
